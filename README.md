Bulkpro is a company that specializes in procuring products (multiple categories) from local manufacturers in bulk and selling them via their website to other local 
purchasers (dealing in bulk quantity) throughout India.

Dataset includes Product Data and Order Data for Bulkpro.

Product Data - This data file includes details of each product that is listed on the website including the product category, the website listing date and the source 
channel through which the manufacturer has connected with Bulkpro to list the products on the website.

Order Data - This data file includes individual order details of different products that are listed on the website including order quantities, order date-time, etc. 
Each order is placed by an individual purchaser.

Task:
Figure out the reason for the decline of overall orders in the Platinum category placed 
(both in terms of the number of orders and in terms of daily product quantities ordered).
Use this data to analyse the performance of each channel / segment that can bring insights on the root cause of the problem and suggestions on key focus areas.

The Key Metrics looked upon are as below:
1. Monthly total order quantity
2. Daily total order quantity
3. Average Daily order quantity per product
4. New products onboarded (Monthly / Weekly / Daily) 
5. Sales of new products onboarded (not every product that is listed on the website would actually be purchased)


Observations:
- The monthly order quantity for platinum has decreased from 39 million to 27 million,
influencing the overall monthly orders from 44 million to 33 million.
- We have the most orders in February month.
- In 4th week we have the highest order count
- Not every product that is released is successful in finding buyers.
- Telesales & Website were the 2 sources that brought the maximum orders
- The product id JD705494JI has the most orders (12.6 million).

Reason for the decline of overall orders in the Platinum category:
- After March orders from Telesales, website & google have decreased significantly
- Orders from the Google search keyword bulkpro decreased by 17.05% in April, while orders
from the sell online keyword increased by 18.05%.

Suggestions:
Since the orders from Telesales & website have significantly decreased other sources can be utilized
for better promotion:
- Promotion on social media - WhatsApp/Facebook campaigns
- Google advertising campaigns
- Make use of the Android app for better push notifications and promotional offers.
- A market survey of customer needs should be conducted so that the most relevant products
can be onboarded. It can be done via phone surveys, email surveys, mobile app surveys, and
so on.
